window.SIDEBAR_ITEMS = {"struct":[["WithCachedTypeInfo","A helper type that you can wrap round your own type in order to automatically cache the stable hash, type flags and debruijn index on creation and not recompute it whenever the information is needed. This is only done in incremental mode. You can also opt out of caching by using StableHash::ZERO for the hash, in which case the hash gets computed each time. This is useful if you have values that you intern but never (can?) use for stable hashing."]]};
